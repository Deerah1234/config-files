# My Neovim Configs
Welcome to my Neovim (nvim) configs repository! This repository contains all the settings and plugins that I use for my daily coding tasks. I use Neovim as my primary code editor because it is lightweight, highly customizable, and can be used in the terminal.

## Installation
To use my nvim configs, you need to have Neovim installed on your machine. You can download and install it by following the instructions in the official Neovim documentation [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim).

Once you have installed Neovim, you can clone this repository into your `~/.config/nvim` directory using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

You can also fork this repository and customize it to your own liking.
